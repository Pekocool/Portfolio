    <h1>User Journeys</h1>
    <p>User journeys have been useful for me to illustrate what makes a service good or bad. They tell a story about what works or doesn't work with a service, in addition to the context the user is in.</p>

        <h2>Tinder User Journey</h2>
        <p>I was tasked with creating a user journey, which would address what a new service for Tinder would look like.</p>
        <p>
            The first thing I thought of was what the road would look like. I went for the heart/love theme, and therefore thought that the road could be a heart. Where the heart descends, it goes badly, and where it rises, it goes better.</p>
        <p>I used icons to express how the main character felt. To explain more in depth about what was going on, I used text boxes.</p>

        <h2>Chindogu User Journey</h2>
        <p>I created this user journey to illustrate how a product I created could work in practice.</p>
        <p>I went for a slightly different style on this one, compared to the Tinder user journey. I think the style I use here is a little more clear, as it is divided into clear phases, and uses emojis to express the feelings along the way.</p>
